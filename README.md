# rdf2vec from SAREF Graph data and MLP training
 
This script can be used to create vector representations from a knowledge graph (KG) using rdf2vec. 
The KG is assumed to have followed the SAREF ontology [[1]](#SAREF) to describe series of measurements made by smart devices.
pipeline_rdf2vec_mlp.ipynb provides a more indepth walkthrough.

The data in the graph consists of energy consumption from several smart devices, originally from the Household dataset from OPDS [[2]](#OPDS) and Historical Weather Data retrieved from World Weather Online.
